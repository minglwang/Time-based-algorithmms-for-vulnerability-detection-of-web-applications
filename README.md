# Description
**Blind SQL injections** are time-based SQL attacks that request web applications to sleep for a specified amount of time (*Sleep time*). Typically, the response time to url request in **vulnerable web applications will be affected** by such SQL attacks **while safe web application will not**. However, the response time is also contaiminated by the *network delay*. Therefore,
for a safe web application,

> *Response time = network delay*,

while for a vulnerable web application,

> *Response time = Sleep time + network delay*,

where *network delay* is a stochastic phenonmenon in the trassmission bettween the server and local user. Using the response time to classify a web application as safe or not will result in **false positive** (type I error, which means we classify the safe web application as a vulnerable one) due to stochastic *network delay*. 

To deal with the false positive problem and make sure the is online appliable, we designed a time-based algorithm such that **the false positive rate** less than a small positive value, e.g. 0.01% and can be **completed within a few seconds**. 

Two approaches are developed
1. a t-test approach
2. Chi-square test approach. 

Both approaches contain sampling the *stochastic network delay* which may take 1 or 2 minutes. This sampling can do offline.
The t-test approach takes about 30 seconds which is too long for online usage.
The advantage of Chi-square test is that it require only one sample of the response time which will **complete within a few seconds** and maintain the **the false positive rate** at the same time.

The basic idea of the two approaches are explained in 
[report file](https://github.com/minglwang/Web_App_Vulnerability_Detection/blob/master/Mingliang_Report.pdf). 

# How To Use
To use the code, one need to 

1. run "app.py" using spider ("app.py" is a Python code simulating the web applications (both safe and unsafe ones).
2. In the IPython console panel, open a new consol panel to run the t test or chi_square test.
2. run the "t_test.py" to run the t-test approach
3. run the "chi_square_test.py" to run the proposed chi-square test approach
